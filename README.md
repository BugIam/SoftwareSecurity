# Questions and Answers

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client was Artemis Financial. They want an additional layer of security (file verification step) for their web application to ensure secure communications.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
In assessing their security vulnerabilities, I assess their current protection and evaluate against any potential threats then make a suggestions. It is important to code securely to protect the information that you're handling, it might be to protect yourselves from going out of business and avoid legal consequences or it might be due to government regulations on the area you're working on. Security makes a company reputation and makes them become trustworthy in the eyes of the public. 

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The challenging part was to evaluate the area of security applicable to the client. Even though you do your best, you miss on one or two. It is always good to have a second pair of eyes when doing such. 

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I first indentify the area of security, then run some static testing. I would use the same strategies in the future to the determine mitigation techniques.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensure the code and software application were functional by running the program and secure by addressing the issue found in static testinh. After refactoring code, I ran another dependency check. 

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
All resources and tools provided by the instructor in this class was helpful and they can applied to other classes which I am going to do. 

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
In this assignment, I can showcase my new skill acquired which is to conduct static testing and address vulnerabilities.
